I have used RapidAPI for both Amazon and Wayfair
- https://rapidapi.com/ajmorenodelarosa/api/amazon-price1
- https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/wayfair

I also have added code to scrap Amazon.com directly but didn't implement it in the solution.

## **Expectation:**
1. We are looking for a basic functional application and the focus will be on the code structure, logic and coverage of edge cases.
Yet to implement
- Search by price and stocks status
- filter by price / stock status
- Infinite scroll is not smooth
- Search text spell check has been implemented but no ML model for any synonyms/relevant keywords
- APIs used have poor rate limits and limited functionality.

2. Push the code to a public Github repository and share the link with us.

3. Host it on the internet
